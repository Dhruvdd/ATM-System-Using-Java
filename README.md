# ATM-System-Using-Java

I have developed this ATM System in java where I have created a dummy bank in it and user can Log-in or can Create an Account with his personal info.

I have create an ATM program for representing ATM transection.
In the ATM program, the user needs to choose a choice from the choices showed on the screen. The first alternatives are Create an Account or Log-in.

After choosing the choices the atlernatives are Withdraw Money | Deposit Money | Balance Inquiry | Exit.

For Withdraw Money, we simply get the withdrawal amount from the user and remove that amount from the total balance.

For Deposit Money, we simply get the deposit amount from the user and add it to the total balance.

For Balance Inquiry, we simply print the total balance of the user.

For Exit, simply exit the current Transaction mode and return the user to the home page or initial screen.
